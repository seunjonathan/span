# Introduction 
There are existing artifacts that realise TOPS ETL functionality within the `EDW` framework, e.g. `adfv2-edw-prod`. This project is to capture new TOPS related ETL,
inline with the motivation to separate source specific functionalities into different more manageable Azure infrastructure.

This project will initially host the Azure Data Factory pipelines related to the data from the Prism/BeaverLabs endpoint. In the future it may be enhanced to cover
other TOPS related ETLs too.
