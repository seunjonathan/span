Attached below is an API requirement template spreadsheet that facilitates the integration process of data sources into SMG's data lake. The template would help streamline the development of ETL pipelines by providing consistent integration guidelines.

The document include sections covering `API overview`, `authentication`, `data access`, `rate limiting`, `data format`, `pagination`, `data synchronization`, `dependencies`, `documentation`, `testing` and `compliance`.

The template is customizable to accommodate project-specific details. 

Sample API requests and responses could be provided within the template for testing and validation purposes
