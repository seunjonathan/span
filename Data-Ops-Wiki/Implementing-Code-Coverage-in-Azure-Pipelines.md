  To implement code coverage in Azure Pipelines, we need to update the YAML file in Azure DevOps. Our goal is to run unit tests and generate coverage reports for the main code file in each repository.

**Prerequisites:**
•	Ensure that the repositories have a YAML file with Azure Pipelines configuration.

**Step 1: Install pytest**
In the YAML file, we need to install pytest using a command. This ensures that pytest is available in the build environment to execute unit tests.

**Yaml sample code:**

steps:
- script: pip install pytest
  displayName: 'Install pytest'

**Step 2: Run Unit Tests**
Next, we add scripts for all the test script files containing the unit tests for the main code file. For each test script, a coverage.xml file is generated. We will have multiple scripts for each test file.
We’ll rename the coverage files at the end of each script by using Linux command (for performing any other operations on the files generated we can use Linux commands).

**Yaml sample code:**

steps:
- script: pytest test_file_1.py --cov=main_code.py --cov-report xml:coverage.xml
mv coverage.xml coverage_file_1.xml
  displayName: 'Run Unit Tests for test_file_1.py'

- script: pytest test_file_2.py --cov=main_code.py --cov-report xml:coverage.xml
mv coverage.xml coverage_file_1.xml
  displayName: 'Run Unit Tests for test_file_2.py'

- script: pytest test_file_3.py --cov=main_code.py --cov-report xml:coverage.xml
mv coverage.xml coverage_file_1.xml
  displayName: 'Run Unit Tests for test_file_3.py'

**Step 3: Merge Coverage.xml Files**
After executing all the scripts for the unit test files, we need to merge the coverage.xml files using an external tool called "report generator," available in Azure DevOps Marketplace. The merged format is called Cobertura.

**Yaml sample code:**

steps:
- script: reportgenerator -reports:coverage_file_1.xml;coverage_file_2.xml;coverage_file_3.xml -targetdir:merged_coverage -reporttypes:Cobertura
  displayName: 'Merge Coverage.xml Files using Report Generator'

**Step 4: Publish Code Coverage Results**
Finally, we create a task to publish the code coverage results using the "PublishCodeCoverageResults" task. This task does the real work it takes the coverage.xml files generated from all the test runs and generates a final coverage report in Azure devops through which we can identify if our tests cover all the functions and edge cases.

**Yaml sample code:**

steps:
- task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1
  inputs:
    codeCoverageTool: 'Cobertura'
    summaryFileLocation: 'merged_coverage/Cobertura.xml'

**Pipeline Trigger**
Whenever changes are pushed or committed to the main branch of the repository, the pipeline will trigger automatically, running the respective unit tests and generating code coverage reports. The code coverage results will be published, providing insights into the functionality of the main code file. This approach enables us to monitor the code coverage of our main code file and ensures that it serves the desired functionality while maintaining testability and quality of the codebase.
